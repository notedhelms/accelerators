## Corticon Starter Templates

Corticon and Corticon.js can be used for many purposes, so these templates are broken out into three main categories.

- **[Classic Templates](classic-templates/README.md)**: Rule Project templates for use in Corticon Studio and deployed to a Corticon Server
- **[Serverless Templates](js-templates/README.md)**: Rule Project templates for use in Corticon.js Studio, and generated into a JavaScript Decision Function
- **[Dynamic Form Templates](form-templates/README.md)**: Rule Project templates for use in Corticon.js Studio, and generated into a JavaScript Decision Function driving client-side dynamic form behavior 

<!-- ## Corticon Starter Rule Vocabularies

These are pre-built rule vocabularies, generated from JSON schemas and other data model representations of openly available ontologies.
