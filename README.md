# Corticon Starter Templates

Corticon and Corticon.js can be used for many purposes, so these templates are broken out into three main categories.

- **Classic Templates**: Rule Project templates for use in Corticon Studio and deployed to a Corticon Server
- **Serverless Templates**: Rule Project templates for use in Corticon.js Studio, and generated into a JavaScript Decision Function
- **Dynamic Form Templates**: Rule Project templates for use in Corticon.js Studio, and generated into a JavaScript Decision Function driving client-side dynamic form behavior 



## Classic Templates +
