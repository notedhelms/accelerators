Creating a dynamic form can be a slog even when you know what you're doing. It's time consuming, repetitive, and frankly runs the risk of transforming front end developers into Jack Torrance from [The Shining](https://static.tumblr.com/72b7451c23e74696386ae2e2c05a8761/alu9pkg/eSdnfi67l/tumblr_static_7lu60nk316gw4sggg4owgcwgg_640_v2.jpg). 

But with Corticon.js, dynamic forms can be created in a fraction of the time, with substantial contributions from non-developers, and through a framework-agnostic design pattern that maximizes the reusability of form logic.
