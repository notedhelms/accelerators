The rules are organized into separate rulesheets, each addressing specific aspects of maintenance. For example, the "Calculate_Aircraft_Usage" rulesheet calculates various parameters such as total miles and hours based on the aircraft's age, while other rulesheets like "Check_Engine_Oil," "Change_Engine_Oil," "Change_Tires," and others specify conditions and actions for maintenance tasks such as oil checks, oil changes, tire changes, and more. Each rule within a rulesheet is assigned a unique identifier and status (enabled or disabled), and conditions trigger corresponding actions or rule statements for performing maintenance tasks. The rulesheets collectively provide a comprehensive set of guidelines for maintaining different components of an aircraft based on its age, usage, and specific requirements.
